					Garmin Venu 2 GPS smart watch
				</header>
				<p>
					As well as functioning as a stylish multi-sports watch, this sports gadget aims to monitor your body's health. It scores the quality of your sleep, so you can hop back into bed if necessary. You can also check in with your body's battery level to assess whether you have enough energy for that run or not. You can also discover your fitness age, and set hydration goals which adjust depending on how much you sweat during a particular sport, so it's not short of snazzy features.
					It has more than 25 preloaded apps tailored to specific sports, so you can track your progress whether you're a swimmer, runner, walker, cyclist, golfer or HIIT enthusiast.

					You can pair it with your smartphone to receive calls, social media alerts and text notifications too. We're fans of the sleek look. It's not too bulky or overly sporty in appearance, so it works well as a smart, everyday watch as well as a sports gadget.

					Theragun Elite
				</header>
				<p>
					If you're in need of a post-workout recovery sports gadget to help with achy muscles, this triangular massage gun could do the trick. The Theragun massage tools feature percussive therapy which aims to reach 60 per cent deeper into your muscles to help relieve muscle tension. The device claims to press against your body up to 40 times per second, so you should expect a rapid and rhythmic motion.

					The Theragun Elite has five different attachments, so you can choose to target your shoulder blades, lower back or even your hands and feet, depending on what you've put your body through that day. There's an app where you can alter the speed, and access customised wellness routines too.

					Hydrow Rower
				</header>
				<p>
					Fancy a home gym revamp? This rowing machine lets you watch athletes and their rowing fitness routines on a 22-inch touchscreen display as you follow along. You can even watch an athlete in real time as they glide through the water, or you can watch at a time when suits. You can also check in to a range of locations too, so while it may not be the same as actually viewing the New York skyline in person, it's a nice change from your local gym.

					The electromagnetic and computer-controlled drag mechanism aims to provide an authentic experience that resembles the sensation of actually being in the water. So if you enjoy rowing, but could do without the cold or early rise, this could be a rather expensive, but worthwhile, alternative.
